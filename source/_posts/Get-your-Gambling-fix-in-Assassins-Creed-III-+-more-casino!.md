#  Assassins creed III – how to get gambling and more casino action

If you’re looking for more gambling and casino action in Assassin’s Creed III, you’ll want to head to the Frontier. There are three casinos located in the game world, and each one has its own unique set of mini-games.

The first casino is in Boston, and it’s called the Green Dragon. This place is home to a blackjack table, a roulette wheel, and a slot machine. The blackjack table is pretty straightforward – just match your cards as closely as possible to 21 without going bust. The roulette wheel has a few extra betting options, but the basic premise is still the same – predict where the ball will end up after it spins around the wheel. And finally, the slot machine offers three different types of gameplay: normal spins, frenzy mode, and super frenzy mode.

The second casino is in New York, and it’s called the Cotton House. This place has a little bit of everything: blackjack, poker, roulette, and slots. In addition to those classic games, there’s also a dice table that lets you wager on whether the number shown will be higher or lower than the number you choose.

Finally, there’s the Salty Dog in Charlestown – the most dangerous place in all of Assassin’s Creed III! This casino only has roulette and slots, but both games offer some great opportunities to win big bucks. The roulette table has a double-up feature that allows you to gamble your winnings on the next spin. And if that wasn’t risky enough, there’s also an optional side bet that rewards players who manage to land on either red or black six times in a row! As for slots… well, they don’t get much more exciting than this: three different progressive jackpots are up for grabs!

#  Gambling in assassins creed III – tips and tricks to get the most out of your gaming experience

 assassination is all about making difficult decisions. weighing the risks and rewards of your potential actions before choosing the most advantageous one. in the world of assassins creed III, this philosophy is also true for gambling. so if you're looking to make some extra cash (or just kill some time), we've put together a few tips and tricks to help you get the most out of your gambling experience in the game.

## first things first: know your odds

before you start throwing your money around at various tables, it's important to understand the odds that you're working with. in assassins creed III, most table games have a house edge of around 2-3%. so if you're betting on a game where your odds are 50/50, you can expect to lose about 2-3% of your money each time you play.

of course, these odds vary from game to game. blackjack, for example, has much better odds for players than roulette – so if you're looking to maximise your chances of winning, it's best to stick to games like blackjack and poker.

## choose your battles wisely

gambling can be a very risky business – especially if you're not familiar with the games that you're playing. so before you start blowing your hard-earned cash on table games, it's important to learn the basics first. take your time, read up on the rules and play a few practice rounds until you feel comfortable enough to start betting real money.

even once you've mastered the basics, it's still important to be selective about which games you play. as we mentioned earlier, blackjack and poker offer better odds for players than casino games like roulette and slot machines. so if you're looking to minimise your losses, it's best to stick with these games.

## use your head (and heart) when betting

gambling isn't just about making smart decisions – it's also about taking risks! after all, what's the point in gambling if you're not willing to risk losing some of your money? so when it comes time to bet, don't be afraid to go all in – especially if there's a big payoff waiting for you on the other side.

of course, this doesn't mean that you should go into every game expecting to lose. there will definitely times when it makes sense to fold or even walk away from the table with your money still in hand. but as long as you approach gambling with a healthy mix of caution and bravado, you'll be able to make some serious profits while playing assassins creed III!
