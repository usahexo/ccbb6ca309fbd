#  How to Report Gambling Winnings on Your Wisconsin Tax Return

If you won money from a casino, racetrack, or other gambling establishment in Wisconsin, you may be required to report the winnings on your state income tax return. The amount of gambling income you must report and pay taxes on depends on the type of gambling activity and your total taxable income.

Here are the basics on how to report gambling winnings on your Wisconsin tax return:

*Report your total taxable gambling winnings as Other Income on Line 21 of your Form 1040.

*If you itemize deductions on your tax return, you can claim a deduction for gambling losses up to the amount of your winnings. Deductible losses are reported on Schedule A as Miscellaneous Deductions.

*Keep track of both your winnings and losses throughout the year to ensure that you don't overstate your losses or underreport your income. You will need to provide documentation of both if requested by the IRS.

The IRS requires you to report all of your taxable gambling winnings, whether they were from legal or illegal activities. Gambling income includes cash prizes, jackpots, raffle winnings, and any other proceeds from gambling activities. It does not include winning lottery tickets, which are treated as a form of gifts and not income.

You must also report any compensation received from a casino or other gaming establishment as taxable income. This includes salaries, tips, commissions, and any other payments received for providing gambling services.

#  5 Things to Know About Wisconsin Taxes

When it comes to state taxes, Wisconsin is one of the best places to be. The Badger State has a low flat tax rate, no income tax, and no inheritance or estate tax. Here are five more things to know about Wisconsin's taxes:

1. Wisconsin Has a Low Flat Tax Rate

Wisconsin has a flat tax rate of 5.6%, which is lower than the national average of 6.2%. This means that everyone pays the same percentage of their income in taxes, regardless of their salary.

2. There Is No Income Tax in Wisconsin

As mentioned earlier, Wisconsin is one of the few states that does not have an income tax. This makes it a popular destination for retirees and people who want to reduce their taxable income.

3. There Are No Inheritance or Estate Taxes in Wisconsin

Wisconsin also doesn't have any estate or inheritance taxes, which is another reason why it's a popular destination for retirees. WI estate tax laws changed as of January 1, 2018; under previous law, estates worth more than $1 million were subject to taxation at a rate of up to 16%. However, there is still no death or inheritance tax on personal property in WI.

4. Sales Tax Is High in Wisconsin

While income and property taxes are low in WI, sales tax is high. The state sales tax rate is 5%. In addition, local municipalities can charge an additional 2% sales tax, for a total of 7%. This makes WI one of the most heavily taxed states when it comes to consumer goods.

5. Property Taxes Are Low in Wisconsin

Even though sales taxes are high, property taxes are low in WI. The average effective property tax rate is just 0.84%, which ranks as the 20th lowest in the country.
