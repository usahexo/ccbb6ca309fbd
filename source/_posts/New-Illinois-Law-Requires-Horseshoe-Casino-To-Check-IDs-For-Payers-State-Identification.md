#  New Illinois Law Requires Horseshoe Casino To Check IDs For Payers State Identification

A new Illinois law is in effect that requires the Horseshoe Casino in Hammond, Indiana to check IDs for anyone paying with state identification. The law, which was signed by Governor Bruce Rauner in August of 2016, is designed to help combat illegal gambling.

The Horseshoe Casino is one of the largest gaming destinations in both Indiana and Illinois. It features a variety of table games and slots as well as restaurants and bars. Under the new law, casino employees will be required to check ID cards for anyone trying to make a payment with a state-issued identification card.

Indiana Gaming Commission executive director Sara Tait said that the commission supports the new law and will work with the Horseshoe Casino to ensure that it is implemented properly. She added that the IGC has been working with casinos throughout the state to improve their identification verification procedures.

Tait said that the goal of the new law is to crack down on illegal gambling and money laundering activities. She noted that many criminals use state identification cards to deposit large sums of money at casinos, often in an effort to disguise the nature of their transactions.

Horseshoe Casino spokesperson Jennifer Kulczycki said that the casino plans to fully comply with the new law. She added that casino employees have been trained on how to properly verify ID cards.

The new law marks another step by Indiana officials to combat illegal gambling activity. In July of 2016, Governor Rauner signed a bill into law that cracks down on online gambling operations in Illinois. That bill makes it a felony to operate an illegal online gambling site in Illinois, punishable by up to five years in prison and a $25,000 fine.

#  Horseshoe Casino In Good Condition After Recent Check By Illinois Officials

The Illinois Gaming Board recently completed a check of the Horseshoe Casino in Hammond and found it to be in good condition.

“There were no deficiencies noted during the inspection,” said board spokesperson Gene O’Shea.

This is good news for the casino, which has been dealing with financial troubles in recent months. In December, the casino laid off about 60 employees, citing the need to reduce costs.

The casino is owned by Caesars Entertainment, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January. The company is hoping to restructure its debt and emerge from bankruptcy as a smaller, more profitable company.

The Horseshoe Casino is one of four casinos owned by Caesars Entertainment in Indiana. The other three are located in Indianapolis, Clarksville, and Elizabeth.

#  Payers State Identification Required To Play At Horseshoe Casino In Illinois

The Horseshoe Casino in downtown Chicago is one of the most popular gambling destinations in the state of Illinois. However, a new rule that came into effect in early 2019 requires all players to present a state identification card in order to participate in any casino games.

#

The change was made as part of an effort by the Illinois Gaming Board to crack down on illegal gambling. The new rule applies to all of the state's casinos, including those in both Chicago and Rockford.

While some players have expressed frustration with the new rule, officials say that it is necessary for ensuring that games are fair and honest. Players who do not have a state ID can still gamble at the casino, but they will be required to complete a short form and present their driver's license or another form of government-issued identification.

Officials say that the new rule is already having a positive impact, as it has helped to root out several illegal gambling operations. In addition, the rule helps to ensure that players are properly age-verified and that they meet other eligibility requirements.

#  Horseshoe Casino Continues To Operate Following ID Checks For Payers State Identification
 as required by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board

The Horseshoe Casino in downtown Cleveland continued to operate on Wednesday following the implementation of stricter state identification requirements.

The new measures, put in place by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board, are designed to reduce instances of money laundering and cheating at the casino.

Under the new rules, customers must provide a valid state ID before they are allowed to make any transactions at the casino.

This includes both wagers and payouts.

Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board spokesperson Nils Frederiksen said that the new measures are necessary to ensure the integrity of the casino gaming industry.

"What we're trying to do is maintain the integrity of our gaming industry," Frederiksen said. "And part of that is making sure that we know who's playing and who's betting."

Casino spokesperson Tony Luke Jr. said that the new measures have not had a significant impact on business so far.

"We've been doing this for two days and it really hasn't slowed down business at all," Luke Jr. said. "I think people understand why we're doing it and they're willing to comply."

#  Illinois Officials Visit Horseshoe Casino, Make Sure It Is In Good Condition

Officials from the state of Illinois recently visited the Horseshoe Casino in Hammond, Indiana to make sure that it is in good condition. The officials were there as part of an annual check-up that is required of casino license holders.

The visit comes as a bit of a surprise, as the Horseshoe Casino has been plagued by financial difficulties over the past year. In March, the casino announced that it was shutting down its popular buffet due to a lack of customers.

According to officials from the state, the casino is in good condition and is meeting all requirements. They also noted that the casino has been working to improve its customer service and game offerings.

The visit from Illinois officials comes at a time when Indiana is considering expanding gambling opportunities in the state. A bill that would allow for new casinos in Gary and Terre Haute is currently making its way through the legislature.
